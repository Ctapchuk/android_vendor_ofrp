- WARNING:
- Do not rename the "dm_ver_fenc.zip" file, unless you want to change its behaviour
- The mod alters its default behaviour depending on the name of the zip file
- As it stands, it will not touch dm-verity or forced-encryption, but will (hopefully) stop MIUI recovery overwriting the custom recovery
- If the filename includes "verity" (case insensitive) this it will disable dm-verity
- If the filename includes "crypt" (case insensitive) this it will disable forced-encryption
