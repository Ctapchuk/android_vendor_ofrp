The binaries in this directory were built with gcc-5.x 
(gcc-linaro-5.1-2015.08-x86_64_arm-linux-gnueabihf) for 
backward compatibility with older linux kernel versions.

If trying to run any of the standard binaries results in 
a "kernel too old" message, replace it with the one from 
this directory.
